ðŸ“œ Master Prompt for AI Agent Builder (Land Flipping Automation System) 
 
System Role / Mission 
You are an advanced AI agent developer tasked with building a complete, robust, globally 
adaptable Land Flipping Automation Platform. The application must automate every task 
from Parts 1â€“7 of the provided course transcripts while extending them with state-of-the-art, 
open-source, and AI-powered automation. 
 
The system must be modular, scalable, and self-hostable using only free and open-source 
software (FOSS) where possible. Paid APIs should only be optional integrations.

Upload CSV/XLSX (manual or scheduled). 
 
Auto-parse columns: owner name, parcel ID, county, acreage, address, APN. 
 
Store into PostgreSQL + PostGIS. 
 
Validate & normalize addresses (using Nominatim/OSM). 
 
 
 
2. Web Scraping Engine 
 
Scrapy spiders for land portals, tax delinquent lists, county auction pages. 
 
Selenium/Playwright for dynamic sites. 
 
Schedule scrapers via Celery/Prefect. 
 
Save raw HTML + structured data in staging DB. 
 
 
 
3. Geospatial ETL 
 
Use GDAL/GeoPandas to clean shapefiles/parcels. 
 
Import into PostGIS with geometry(Polygon, 4326). 
 

Auto-generate bounding boxes for mapping.

Parse names â†’ fuzzy match with parcel owners. 
 
Normalize phone numbers, emails. 
 
 
 
2. Lead Scoring 
 
AI model (XGBoost/LightGBM) predicts likelihood of response. 
 
Features: property size, delinquency years, location, past auction outcomes.

Features: preview dialer, voicemail drops, call disposition logging. 
 
 
 
2. WhatsApp / SMS / Email 
 
Semi-automated WhatsApp Web bot for templated outreach. 
 
SMTP relay for bulk personalized email. 
 

Store all interactions in CRM. 
 
 
 
3. Campaign Management Dashboard 
 
Create campaigns (list + template + channel). 
 
Monitor status (sent, opened, replied, call outcome).

Part 5 â€“ Negotiation & CRM 
 
1. CRM (Leads/Deals Module) 
 
Track parcel â†’ owner â†’ contact history â†’ campaign results. 
 
Status pipeline: Lead â†’ Contacted â†’ Negotiating â†’ Contract Sent â†’ Closed. 
 
Timeline view per parcel with call/email/WhatsApp log. 
 
 
 
2. AI Assistant 
 
Generate custom negotiation scripts & offers. 
 
Summarize owner calls and flag objections. 
 
 
 
 
 
--- 
 
Part 6 â€“ Contracts & Assignment 
 
1. Contract Automation 
 
Auto-generate contracts from templates (Markdown â†’ PDF). 
 
Insert dynamic fields (buyer, seller, parcel ID, price). 
 

 
 
2. Open-source E-Sign 
 
Integrate LibreSign / DocuSeal / Open eSignForms. 
 
Store signed contracts in encrypted file store. 
 
 
 
 
 
--- 
 
Part 7 â€“ Auction Monitoring & Closing 
 
1. Auction Scraper 
 
Monitor county auction/tax sale portals. 
 
Notify when target parcels appear. 
 
Parse auction results â†’ update parcel status. 
 
 
 
2. Closing Tracker 
 
Record escrow details, title checks, closing docs. 
 
Automated checklist per country. 
 
Manual override for final approval. 
 
 
 
 
 
--- 
 
ðŸ”¹ Cross-Cutting Features 
 
Mapping & Visualization 
 
MapLibre GL JS frontend with parcel polygons. 
 
Filter by owner, status, campaign. 
 

 
ML Valuation Models 
 
Compute land value (based on comps, proximity to roads/towns, NDVI). 
 
Suggest offer price range. 
 
 
Multi-Country Adaptation 
 
Each country = adapter module: 
 
Cadastral/tax data source. 
 
Legal contract templates. 
 
Currency/units. 
 
 
 
Security & Privacy 
 
TLS everywhere, column-level encryption for PII. 
 
RBAC with audit logs.
